# Hidden-Markov-Model

Your program reads in 7 lines input.

The first 6 lines should contain an observation and the sock location separated by the | character.

The final line should contain only the observation.

The program should outputs the probability (in percentage) that the sock is hidden in each location to 2 decimal places. The locations are listed in alphanumerical order.

If the model cannot calculate the probabilities for a location, it outputs undefined instead
